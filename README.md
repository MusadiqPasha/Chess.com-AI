# Chess.com-AI
A Python program that takes screenshots of the `chessboard`  while playing on `chess.com`  and uses  `STOCKFISH`  to generate the best possible move and uses `pyautogui` to make the moves on the website.

It can play in 
- Both as BLACK and WHITE
- RAPID
- BLITZ
- BULLET MATCHES

with almost `99% ACCURACY`

### What steps you have to follow??
- Download or clone my Repository to your device
- type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in command prompt(this will install required package for project)
- Make sure to install the modren version of `STOCKFISH` from [STOCKFISH](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases/download/sf_16/stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.zip) and add it to the system path.
- You should adjust the screenshot co-ordinates based on your display ratio so that the screenshot function only take the screenshot of the `CHESSBOARD`
- Make sure to change the chessboard theme setting as given below and enable auto-promote to queen.
- Just run the `chess.com RAPID FINAL.py` or  `chess.com BULLET Final.py`

### Project flow & explaination

- After you run the project , the program will detect if we are playing as BLACK or WHITE and flips the board if we're playin as BLACK.
- It'll automatically take the `SCREENSHOT` of the given chessboard region into `FEN NOTATION` when our timer starts.
- It'll send the `FEN NOTATION` to `STOCKFISH` to generate the BEST MOVE.
- You can adjust `STOCKFISH` LEVEL and DEPTH to generate the move more accurately.
- Then the program will move the 'MOVE' suggested by `STOCKFISH` on the `CHESSBOARD`
